This project is especially valuable for drone enthusiasts and amateur videographers who face the challenge of handling video files that are automatically split by devices like the DJI Mini 4 Pro. With EZmerge, merging video clips is quick, easy, and doesnâ€™t require the complex features of professional editing software.",
